title: RosiVM The Beginning
---

Hello world! This is RosiVM. It is statically typed, AoT compiled language with minimalistic runtime and big hearth.

It is inspired by the C#, TypeScript, ActionScript, Java, C and C++ languages.

The project has a compiler frontend written in C++ and uses llvm as compiler backend. It is still in very early stage of development so stay tuned for updates.
